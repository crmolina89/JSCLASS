        Step 1
        Create a JavaScript Variables each with it's own type. 
        String, boolean, number.  
        Use == and === to compare each one with a console.log 
        using IF statements. 
        
        create 2 string variables.
        2 boolean variables (one true one false)
        create 2 number variables, ( one zero and one with a number greater than zero)
        
        compare the strings, numbers and booleans with each of it's own
        type and with the other types.
        
        Step 2
        write a loop, one that counts from 10 to 0 and 
        another that counts from 0 to 10.
